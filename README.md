# CPP_Module_02
This module is about ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form.

From now on, all classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form. There must be
- a default constructor,
- a copy constructor,
- a copy assignment operator and
- a destructor.

The exercises of this module are about **fixed-point numbers**.
